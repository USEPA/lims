Creating a new LIMS processor

Clone Git repo from: 
https://github.com/USEPA/lims

Launch Visual Studio 2022
Open the LIMS Visual Studio Solution file:
lims_server.sln

Add new C# class library project in Processors folder.
Include project reference for PluginBase. This gives access to DataProcessor base class.
All processors are derived from DataProcessor base class located in the PluginBase project.

Currently processors handle .xlsx, .xls, and text files. Here are some representative examples
File Type	Processor Example
.xlsx		MMB_Weights	
.xls		PicoGreen		
.txt		ACESD_DIC		Tab delimited
.csv		CPHEA_IC		Comma delimited

You can use the MyInstrument_template.cs.txt file as the basis for the new processor.

Use the OfficeOpenXml package for working with .xlsx files.
Use the ExcelDataReader package for working with older .xls files.
